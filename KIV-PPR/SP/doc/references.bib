	abstract = {Abstract Logarithmic spiral phenomena are often appeared in nature. In this letter, we show that a logarithmic spiral can realize an effective strategy regarding the metaheuristics and propose a new two-dimensional metaheuristics called spiral optimization utilizing a feature of the logarithmic spiral. The simulation results for two-dimensional benchmark problems show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed method. Â© 2010 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.
